# RxWriter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer:

1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

   - Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version
   - This will also install npm (Node Package Manager)

2. **Verify installation**: Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

## Getting Started

Type these commands into the Terminal of your code editor like VS Code

### 1. Clone the Repository 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pharmadevs-ca/rxwriter
cd rxwriter
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This downloads all the required packages for the project.

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. View Your App

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
